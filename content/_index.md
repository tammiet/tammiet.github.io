I'm a full stack developer with experience developing in React, Django, C#, and
SQL. Since graduating from [Calvin College](https://calvin.edu/) two years ago
I've worked as a consultant for [NewFoundry](http://thenewfoundry.com/) and
[Menlo Innovations](https://menloinnovations.com/). I am passionate about
helping more girls discover a love for computers. Until I graduated from
college, I was a facilitator at [Girls Who Code](https://girlswhocode.com/) and
part of [Google's IgniteCS](https://sites.google.com/view/ignitecs) program.
